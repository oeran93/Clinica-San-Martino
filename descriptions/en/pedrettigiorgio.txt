Born in Chiavenna (SO) in 1958, he is married with Simonetta Schiappadini (pharmacist) with which he has two sons Alberto and Nicola, born in 1991 and 1993.

When not engaged in one of his different work activities, he loves to relax himself making long mountain trekking with his family.

The medical activity is not the only passion of Dr. Pedretti; after the family, flying with the helicopter is his real big passion, a relief valve both physical that mental from the daily stress of a profession more and more demanding and with big responsibilities.
