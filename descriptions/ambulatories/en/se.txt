Senology is the branch of medicine that deals with breast cancer, one of the most common womenâ€™s tumors that could be easily identifiable through a mammography.  A mammography is an x-ray examination that allows a qualified specialist to examine the breast tissue for any suspicious areas.  At the San Martino Clinic we use the next generation machineries that allows an accurate breast examination reducing to aminimum the  dose of ionizing radiations.
The actual incidence of breast cancer in feminine population is 8%-10% which means that 8-10 in 100women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and this is the reason why an early detection is extremely important in order to program surgical and therapeutic therapies. The mammography can be realized also on patients with breast implant and in case of dense breast has to be integrated with an ultrasound. Mammograms can often show a breast lump before it can be felt. They also can show tiny clusters of calcium called microcalcifications that could be the first sign of first stage cancer.
