			This technique is based on the interaction between a photons beam - directed from a source to a receiver- and the interjected matter,a biological body. The atoms of this interfering  body prevents the photon to reach the receiver, that will generate accurate negative image of the body. The new ward is equipped with remote controlloed digital X-Ray Siemans Luminos RF Classic that, thanks to the digital technic, allow to obtein total body immages reducing to a minimum the level of radiations.

		Diagnostic technic that allows to obtain detailed immages of the body using magnetic fields and radio waves. Therefore, the patience is not exposed to ionizing radiations.  The new ward is equipped with magnetic resonance Siemens Magnetom Essenza of 1,5 Tesla - an ultra soft machinery of only 145cm with a very light magnet provided with 25 elements integrated with bobbin with the exclusive Tim (Total Imaging Matrix) Technology for high quality speedy examination. This machinery, extremely comfortable, is very suitable also for nervy or claustrophobic patients.

		 Diagnostic imaging technic that, using ionizing radiations (x-rays), allows to reproduce  sections or layers of  body parts, and proccess 3D immages. The new radiology ward is equipped qith C scan Siemens Definition AS+ volumetric scanning  of 128 stratum with rotation; it is able to obtain 180cm in only 10 seconds. This technology allows to obtain high definition images with extremely low radiations.
