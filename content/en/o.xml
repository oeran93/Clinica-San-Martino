Since some eyeâ€™s diseases are asymptomatic  everyone should have the eyes examined by an ophthalmologist even if any disturb is perceived.

The ophthalmologic examination typically evaluates:
<ul>
<li>Outward appearance of the eye</li>
<li>Visual acuity</li>
<li>Pupil response to light</li>
<li>Coordination of eye muscles</li>
<li>Interior and back of the eye</li>
<li>Intraocular pressure</li>
<li>Need for eyeglasses or contact lens</li>
</ul>
The conjunctiva and sclera are instead examined with a penlight or a bio microscopy, gently pulling down the lower lid and asking the patient to look upward and downward. Similar technics are used for the examination of cornea and iris.
